# Bullet3DCar_game

Project made for learning how to use bullet physics.

##Objective
Get to the end of the road killing as much red targets as possible while leaving the green ones alive

###How the score works
For each red enemy hit 20 points are given.   
For each green ally hit 25 points are taken.   
At reaching the end of the road 75 points will be given for each green ally standing and 50 points will be substracted for 
each enemy standing.
The time limit is 100 seconds, for every second left at reaching the end of the road 2 points will be given.
